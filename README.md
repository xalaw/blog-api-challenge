#BLOG API CHALLENGE v1
=====================

1. Use npm init to create it afresh.
2. It should support the four CRUD operations for a blog posts resource.
3. GET and POST requests should go to /blog-posts.
4. DELETE and PUT requests should go to /blog-posts/:id.
5. Use Express router and modularize routes to /blog-posts.
6. Add a couple of blog posts on server load so you'll automatically have some data to look at when the server starts.
